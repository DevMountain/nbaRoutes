NbaRoutes
=========

##Objective
Create an Angular application that uses routes navigate through a list of NBA teams

NBA Routes is the first exposure you'll get to building a full fledged app with more than just one 'route'. Take a look at the full working version of the app [here](http://tylermcginnis.github.io/nbaRoutes). Notice that every route, whether it's the home page or individual team pages, all are retrieving  data before the route loads by using a **resolve**.

In this repo you'll continue to practice fundamental Angular principles you've learned like controllers, services, promises and getting data from RESTful API's while also learning new concepts like routing and resolving data.

## Setup
For this project you're going to need to serve your files through a server
* Fork and clone this repository
* Open up your terminal and (if you have Node/NPM) run
  `npm install -g live-server`
* Now once you want to check out your code, cd into your folder and run
  `live-server`
  The line after should print out: `Starting ... at http://127.0.0.1:8080`
* Go to http://localhost:8080. You should see the beginnings of your application.


## Step 1: Review the Existing Repo Code
A few things have been included for you
* images
* defaultHeaders.js -- makes parse work
* ['ui.router'] as a dependency for our module in app.js

Take a look at how the routes are broken into folders. This is a very easy way to keep things modular!
* 'js/home' folder -- files that all have to do with the home (or index) page
  - view (.html file), controller, and service
* 'js/teams' folder -- files that will be utilized for teams route
  - view (.html file), controller, and service

Check out the index.html page
* nbaRoutes is included as the name of our app
* mainCtrl is included and associated with everything in the main-container
* a menu is created that's going to be at the top of the page for every route
* ui-router script tag -- UI Router doesn't come built-in with Angular
* &lt;div ui-view></div&gt; is included and inside of our index.html

The &lt;div ui-view></div&gt; element and it's placement is crucial to understanding how routing works. That simple &lt;div ui-view></div&gt; holds the power to the universe, or at least the routes inside this app. The router is going to take that element and inject certain templates (html pages) into it depending on which route we're using. The template that is injected into the &lt;div ui-view></div&gt; element depends entirely on what we specify in using the `$stateProvider` object in our app.js file. Creating a router this way allows us to dynamically switch templates and controllers based on the URL.

Once you feel VERY comfortable with the existing codebase, move on to Step 2.


## Step 2: Configure our teamService.js file
This app is going to be very dependent on using **resolve** in the router. As we talked about during the lecture, resolve will call a method in our service, wait for that method's promise to be resolved, then make the data being returned from that service's method available immediately in our controller.
* In your teamService.js file make a method called `addNewGame`. This method is going to take in a gameObject as the parameter. That gameObj will eventually have data about each individual game that we'll send to parse.
  - In the addNewGame method create a variable called `url` and set it equal to `'https://api.parse.com/1/classes/' + gameObj.homeTeam;`. Notice each team's games are going to be stored at a RESTful endpoint which points to the teams specific name (gameObj.homeTeam).
  - After creating the url variable, make an if statement that is going to check to see if the home team score (gameObj.homeTeamScore) is greater then the opponents core (gameObj.opponentScore). If it is, set a property called 'won' on the gameObj to true. If it is not, (or if the home team lost), set that win property on the gameObj to false. One gotcha here is that gameObj.homeTeamScore and gameObj.opponentScore are both strings, you'll need to make them integers before you compare them. To do that, use the parseInt method. `parseInt("7")` will return 7 the integer.
  - Under your if statement, we're going make a POST request to parse to our URL we made earlier, sending `gameObj` as the data. So, return the result of making an $http request with the 'method' of 'POST', the 'url' being the URL variable we made earlier, and 'data' being our `gameObj`.
* Now that our service has an addNewGame method, let's make a `getTeamData` method which is going to accept a team parameter and fetch the data of that specific team. Create it and have it accept a parameter named team.
  - Create a deferred object using $q.defer(); then at the bottom of that function return that promise object (deferred.promise)
  - Create a variable called `url` which will be set to `'https://api.parse.com/1/classes/' + team;`
  - Now, make a 'GET' request using $http to the url of the variable we just made.
  - We're not going to return that object but instead we're going to modify the data we got back from that request before we resolve our own promise we made earlier. So add a `.then` to the end of the $http request and give `.then` a function that accepts 'data' as the parameter. Remember, `data` will be the actual data we get back from parse when we make a GET request to the specified URL we made earlier.
    * Inside the `.then` function, make a variable called `results` and set it equal to `data.data.results`, which is the actual games the team has played.
    * Create two variables, one called `wins` and one called `losses` and set them both equal to `0`.
    * Loop over `results` (which is an array of game objects) and check the `.won` property on each object in the `results` array, if the `.won` property is true, increment wins by 1. If `.won` is not true, increment losses by 1. Now what we've done is gone through all of the games and we now know how many wins and losses that team has.
    * Now that we have complete wins and losses variables, we need to somehow access those variables outside of our service. We know that we have a results array which holds an array of all the games the particular team has played. What if we do something a little unconventional here. We know we're going to eventually resolve our promise we made earlier with the results variable (so we can access all the games in our controller). We also know that an array is really just an object at heart. Let's add a 'wins' property to the results array and set it equal to our wins variable and let's also set a 'losses' property on our results array and set it equal to our losses variable. I know this is a little weird because we're not adding items to our array like we usually do but instead we're adding properties to this array. It's a good reminder that arrays are just objects. Once you add the wins and losses property, go ahead and resolve our deferred object we made earlier with our results array.
  - Make sure that our getTeamData method has a return! Because we are modifying the data we receive from api.parse.com before resolving it, we will need to return the promise on the deferred object rather than returning the $http call like we did in our addNewGame method.

Now that we've set up those two methods on our teamService object, we can close teamService. We won't need to modify this file again but we will need to call the methods we set up in teamService.js later.


## Step 3: Start to Configure the Router
As I mentioned in step 1, setting up the router is perhaps the most important part of this entire application. Our router is going to decide which template and controller get used based on what URL we're currently on.
* Open up your app.js file. Create a state called `'home'` in your router, so that whenever the user is at the index page `'/'`, the templateUrl will be `js/home/homeTmpl.html` and the controller `'homeCtrl'`. We will complete the rest of this route a little later.
* Now we're going to set up the individual team's routes. It's important to understand that all three teams (Jazz, Lakers, Heat) are going to be using the same Controller and the same Template.
  - Whenever the user goes to `'/teams/:team'` use `'js/teams/teamTmpl.html'` as the templateUrl and use `'teamCtrl'` as the controller. Name this state `'teams'`.
  - Take note of the /:team that's in the URL. Remember, that makes it so your application is able to keep track of certain states based on which team is located in the URL. For example, when the user visits yoursite.com/teams/utahjazz, in our controller $stateParams.team is going to be equal to 'utahjazz'. This allows us to then pass in the specific team into our getTeamData method that's on our service and get only that teams data. Also note that the menu in our index.html page has links that point to the different teams (which will be caught by :team in our router).
  - Now that our templateUrl and our controller are set up for the /teams/:team url, we want to have some data ready for us before that route loads. In this case, that data we want available in our controller is the specific teams data. Below where we specify the controller, create a resolve block with the key being `resolve:` and the value being an object.
    * The resolve object is going to have a method called `teamData:` which returns the promise that gets returned from `teamService.getTeamData()`. To be able to use the method getTeamData, we need to inject `teamService` into the `teamData:` method by adding it as a parameter. That was really wordy I know. Look up the syntax for how resolve works. What's going to happen is we're going to call the getTeamData method on our teamService service. That will return a promise which will then be resolved and the data we get back from that promise will then be available to us in our controller as teamData, so head over to your teamCtrl.js file and add teamData as a parameter which is passed into your controller.
    * You might have noticed that we're calling the getTeamData method on our teamService service but that method requires a parameter which should be the specific team whose data we want, ie utahjazz, miamiheat, or losangeleslakers. Remember, we know which team's data we want to get based on the `:team` parameter in our route. We get access to that variable in our resolve block by using `$stateParams.team`. So now go ahead and inject `$stateParams` into the `teamData:` method, and pass `$stateParams.team` as the argument in the `teamService.getTeamData()` call.
* Let's make one last change to the router for now. Add a `$urlRouterProvider.otherwise('/');` block so that the router will redirect to the index page if the route the user types in is not recognized.


## Step 4: Configure the teamCtrl.js File
* Head over to your teamCtrl.js file. We should have four things that are being injected into the controller. `$scope`, `$stateParams` (to give us access to `:team` in the url), `teamService`, and `teamData`. `teamData` hasn't been injected for you yet. teamData is from the previous step. It gives us the data that is being returned from `teamService.getData` in our resolve block in the `app.js` file.
* First thing we want to do is get the data (`teamData`) that is being resolved in our app.js file and put that data on the scope. So in your controller, set `teamData` equal to `$scope.teamData`. Now that data is on our scope and can be accessed in the view.
* Now create a property on the `$scope` object called `newGame` and set it equal to an empty object. This is the object that is going to be passed to `teamService.addNewGame` method later on.

* Create another property on the scope object called `showNewGameForm` and set it equal to `false`. Then create a method on our scope object called `toggleNewGameForm` which takes the current value of `$scope.showNewGameForm` and makes it the opposite of what it currently is. We're going to use both of these properties later on in our view to toggle the form to add a new game.

Now is where we want to see which team's value we should get. Remember this is entirely based on the url. If the user is at `/teams/utahjazz` we want to get the jazz's information. But if they're at `/teams/miamiheat` we want to get the Heat's information. Fortunately, we set up the router so that whatever a team is in the URL, that value would be the current value of `$stateParams.team` in our controller.
* Create an `if` statement and check which team the current URL is on (`utahjazz`, `losangeleslakers`, or `miamiheat`). Depending on which team the URL is on, do the following for each team. Set a property on the scope called `homeTeam` that is equal to 'Utah Jazz', 'Los Angeles Lakers', or 'Miami Heat'. Also, (depending on which team), add a property to the scope called `logoPath` that points to the image of the team. For example, if `$stateParams.team` is equal to 'utahjazz', `$scope.homeTeam` is going to equal 'Utah Jazz' and `$scope.logoPath` is going to equal `'images/jazz-logo.png'`.

Now we want to create a method on our scope object that will be called whenever someone submits a new game.
* Create a method on `$scope` called `submitGame`.
* First thing we want to do is take the `homeTeam` property that we set on the scope earlier and strip out the spaces so we can use it as an endpoint in our restAPI. Add a property onto our `newGame` object that is already on the scope called `homeTeam` and set it equal to `$scope.homeTeam.split(' ').join('').toLowerCase()`
* Now we want to call the `addNewGame` method on our `teamService` method. Call `addNewGame` and pass it `$scope.newGame`
* Take a look at the `teamService.js` file and notice what `addNewGame` returns.
* You should have noticed it returns a promise. That means immediately after we call `addNewGame` we can call `.then()`
* Call `.then` and pass it a callback function. this function is then going to call the `getTeamData` service, passing it `$scope.newGame.homeTeam`. We've added a new game to the home team's schedule and now we need to go and get the new data that's in our database.
* You should notice that the `getTeamData` method is also returning a promise. So just like before, call `.then` immediately after you call `getTeamData()` and give it a callback function which accepts parameter (which is going to be the data returned from the `getTeamData` method)
* Now we want to set a few properties on our scope based off the data we got from our promise. First, set `$scope.teamData` equal to the data you got back from the promise. Then, reset `$scope.newGame` to be an empty object, then set `$scope.showNewGameForm` back to `false`.


## Step 5: Set up for teamTmpl file
Now is the fun part. If everything is working correctly, our team controller and team service should be set up and now all we need to do is put that data onto the view. Head over to your teamTmpl.html file and check it out.
* Notice that there are a lot of `$__FIXME__$`. All of those need to be filled in with properties that are on the teamCtrl. This could be really hard or really easy depending on how you tackle the problem. If it were me, I would console.log the $scope object to see all the properties that you're able to use.
* Fill in all the `$__FIXME__$` with the correct models. Once you do that, make sure you have live-server running and head over to localhost:8080/#/teams/utahjazz and see if everything is working as expected. If it is, great. If not, open up your console and start debugging.


## Step 6: Configure the Home Page.
Go back and check out the live example at http://tylermcginnis.github.io/nbaRoutes . Notice that each team has their own URL in the menu but also the home page is taking all three teams and comparing them side by side. Your job is to now make that possible. You'll need to edit the files in the 'home' folder and also your router in app.js to make it work as expected.
